        Brian Patrick Carroll (born May 13, 1969), known professionally as Buckethead, 
        is an American multi-instrumental musician who has received critical acclaim for 
        his innovative electric guitar playing. When performing, Buckethead wears a white 
        bucket on his head, and an expressionless plain white mask inspired by Halloween 4: 
        The Return of Michael Myers. Recently, Buckehtead has been going on tours more often and
        has been regularly visiting Austin to play shows at Emos. Be on the lookout for his tours
        and don't miss out on his live shows, they are second to none!
